### 5 Critical Issues
```
🔴 #1: DUPLICATE SoT DIRECTORIES
   Locations: 
   - MICRO HYDRO NEW/MicroHydroV1 — SoT/
   - MicroHydroV1 — SoT/
   Impact: Consolidation needed immediately

🔴 #2: 3-LEVEL CIRCULAR REDUNDANCY
   Problem: Same files exist in 4-5 locations
   Solution: Use symlinks instead of copies
   Impact: 100+ MB storage waste

🔴 #3: ACTIVE BACKUP AMBIGUITY
   Path: MicroHydroV1_BACKUP_20260122_005746/
   Date: 2026-01-22 (very recent!)
   Action: Clarify if active or historical

🟠 #4: PRODUCTION PACKAGE VERSIONS
   Versions: v1 and "v2" (MASTER_PRODUCTION_PACKAGE 2)
   Issue: Unclear which is current
   Action: Document and version clearly

🟠 #5: CAD MODEL VERSION AMBIGUITY
   Versions: v1 and v2 (Shapr3D Reference Models)
   Issue: Unclear which is current reference
   Action: Document design evolution, mark current
```
