- Month 5-8: Ramp to 100%
- Month 9-12: Full production

**KPIs:**
- Unit production volume: Target 50+ units
- Cost per unit: $110k-135k
- Time to first customer: Week 12
- Manufacturing efficiency: 95% first-pass yield

### Phase 1: Pre-Production (Months 1-2)

**Objectives:** Finalize suppliers and contracts, set up manufacturing lines, conduct First Article Inspection (FAI), train team.

**Actions:**
1. Supplier Setup: Secure components (generator, inverters, solar panels)
2. Facility Prep: Install assembly lines in workshop
3. FAI: Build prototype, test to specs
4. Training: Certify assembly and QC teams

**Deliverables:** Signed contracts, operational facility, tested prototype, trained staff.

**Timeline:** Week 1-4: Supplier negotiations; Week 5-6: Facility setup; Week 7-8: FAI and training.

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Months 3-4)

**Objectives:** Begin production at 10% capacity, validate supply chain, gather feedback.

**Actions:**
1. Low-Volume Build: Assemble 5-10 units
2. Testing: Field test in controlled environment
3. Feedback Loop: Iterate on design issues
4. Supply Chain Check: Monitor lead times

**Deliverables:** 5-10 functional units, test reports, process improvements.

**Timeline:** Week 9-12: Build and test; Week 13-16: Feedback and adjustments.

### Phase 3: Ramp (Months 5-8)

**Objectives:** Scale to 100% capacity, stabilize quality, optimize processes.

**Actions:**
1. Capacity Increase: Ramp to full production
2. Quality Control: Implement SPC
3. Supplier Optimization: Reduce lead times
4. Customer Prep: Identify beta sites

**Deliverables:** 20-30 units produced, quality metrics >95%, optimized BOM.

**Timeline:** Week 17-24: Ramp to 50%; Week 25-32: Full capacity.

### Phase 4: Full Production (Months 9-12)

**Objectives:** Stabilize operations, deliver to customers, monitor performance.

**Actions:**
1. Customer Delivery: Ship first units
2. Monitoring: Track field performance
3. Scaling: Plan for 50+ units
4. Feedback Integration: Update design

**Deliverables:** 50+ units delivered, performance data, updated roadmap.

**Timeline:** Week 33-40: Initial deliveries; Week 41-52: Full operations.

### Risk Mitigation
- Supply Chain: Multiple suppliers secured
- Quality: Rigorous testing protocols
- Funding: Grants and financing in place
- Technical: Gaps filled; support team ready

### Resources Needed
- Team: 5 engineers, 10 assemblers
- Budget: $500k for setup, $2M for production
- Facilities: 2000 sq ft workshop
- Tools: Assembly jigs, test equipment

### Next Steps
1. Schedule kickoff meeting (Week 1)
2. Finalize suppliers (Week 2)
3. Begin facility setup (Week 3)
