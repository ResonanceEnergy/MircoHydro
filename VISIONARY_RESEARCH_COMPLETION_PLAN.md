# 📋 VISIONARY RESEARCH COMPLETION PLAN - MICROHYDRO

**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Objective:** Complete research on remaining 77 visionaries to reach 80 total (800 insights) for R&D foundation.  
**Current Status:** 3/80 visionaries done (Schauberger, Tesla, Winter); 30/800 insights extracted.  
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (2-3 visionaries/week).  
**Effort:** 1-2 hours/research + 30 min/insights per visionary.  
**Methodology:** Biography/patents review, extract 10 insights, map to design.
